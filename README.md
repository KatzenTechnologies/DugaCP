<h1>DUGA Coder Pack (DugaCP)</h1>
<h2>Advanced modloader for <a href="https://github.com/MaxwellSalmon/DUGA">DUGA raycaster</a></h2><br>
Modloader based on runtime-patching, so only use mods you trust<br>
Inspired by coolmanthedev's modloader, which was static and cannot patch code of the game<br>
Its still in beta-test, so except bugs and report them to us!<br>
<h1>Using DugaAPI</h1>
Font patching is throughAPI <strong>STRONGLY UNRECOMMENDED</strong>, because not all parts using font patched to use API's data!<br>
Our realisation of DUGA's API is not excellent and not full, so you cant do some things with your mod, but you have 2 choices:<br>
<ul>
  <li>You can make realisation for it and make contribution to project! (<strong>GOOD WAY</strong>)</li>
  <li>You can make patch for function through our <a href="">patching API</a>! (<strong>NORMAL WAY</strong>) (but except incompatibilities!!!)</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to make mods?</h1>
Read in <a href="">DugaCP's Documentation (hadnt written it lol)</a><br>
<h1>Liked our work?</h1>
You can report bugs, create & share your mods or do contribution to DugaCP's code!<br>
<h1>And ✨SPECIAL✨ thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MaxwellSalmon">MaxwellSalmon</a> (DUGA's Author) for creating this excellent game!</h1>
