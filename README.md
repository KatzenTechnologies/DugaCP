<h1>DUGA Coder Pack (DugaCP)</h1><br>
<h2>Advanced modloader for <a href="https://github.com/MaxwellSalmon/DUGA">DUGA raycaster</a></h2><br>
Modloader based on runtime-patching, so only use mods you trust<br>
Inspired by coolmanthedev's modloader, which was static and cannot patch code of the game<br>
Its still in beta-test, so except bugs and report them to us!<br>
<h1>How to make mods?</h1>
Our realisation of DUGA's API is not excellent, so you cant do some things, but you can make realisation for it and make contribution!<br>
Read in <a href="">DugaCP's Documentation (hadnt written it lol)</a><br>
<h1>Liked our work?</h1><br>
You can report bugs, create & share your mods or do contribution to DugaCP's code!<br>
